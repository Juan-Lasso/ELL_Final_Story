    As immigrant families arrived in record numbers, some public schools saw their ELL populations explode, exposing deep gaps in educational equity.

    <p>
      There’s always a predictable element of unpredictability at the start of any school year — last-minute enrollments, wonky bus service, a broken bathroom. But in 2023, New York City public schools faced a disruption on a scale few could have imagined.
      It was the first full academic year since migrant children arrived by the tens of thousands amid a historic immigration surge that began in 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
      As immigrant shelters sprouted across the cityscape and buildings were rapidly repurposed to house families, those families were packing their children off to school.
      Many of those students—newcomers from across the globe who had never stepped inside a U.S. classroom or spoken the language—were designated as English Language Learners. ELL students jumped from roughly 135,000 in the 2022–23 school year to more than 148,000 the following year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure, produced through demographic data, is an imperfect but useful proxy for tracking newly arrived immigrant children, in part because schools do not have public data directly tied to a student’s migrant status.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while New York City public schools are growing more linguistically diverse, an analysis of Department of Education data shows just how unevenly that surge has hit — and how heavily the burden has fallen on a subset of city schools.
    </p>

    The steepest spikes in English Language Learner enrollment are concentrated in schools already serving overwhelmingly minority and often low-income students. They have seen their ELL enrollment jump from just a handful to dozens—or even hundreds—in a single school year, with little sign that support systems are keeping up.

    At Mosaic Preparatory Academy in Harlem, the number of English Language Learners soared from just 11 to 70 in a single school year. Less than ten minutes away, P.S. 242 – The Young Diplomats Magnet Academy saw its ELL population surge from 14 to 88.
  </p>

  <p>
    Both schools serve student bodies that are nearly all Black and Latino, significantly higher than the citywide average of 85%.
  </p>

  <h2 class="subhed">Classrooms fill, resources fall behind</h2>

  <p>
    By law, schools must provide ELL students with targeted services — including instruction by certified English as a New Language (ENL) teachers and, where possible, bilingual programs aligned with students’ native languages. But Mosaic’s staff directory lists no ELL teacher.
  </p>

  <p>
    At P.S. 242, which emphasizes an Italian dual-language program and markets itself as an “internationally minded” IB school, there’s no clear mention of support for students who speak Spanish or other languages.
  </p>

  <p>
    “It’s not like the DOE has this central repository of extra teachers that they can just deploy… hiring is done very much at the school level,” said Noah Harlan, CEC District 1 President, whose district has sought to connect migrant families to English Language learning services.
  </p>

  <p>
    Observers note that many migrant families have struggled to maintain school attendance for their children amid a tangle of logistical and bureaucratic obstacles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Harlan noted that while students assigned to schools on the Lower East Side, for instance, were often living in shelters miles away in Midtown, making the daily commute a daunting task. While students were issued MetroCards, their parents or guardians were not, effectively stranding families without a means to get young children to class.
  </p>

  <p>
    “You can’t just send a six-year-old on a subway on their own,” he said.
  </p>

  <p>
    New York City classrooms may never have shifted so dramatically if not for the wave of migrant families who turned to the shelter system. Now, with Mayor Eric Adams moving to shutter 25 sites by July, citing fewer asylum seekers in the city’s care, those enrollment surges may be easing. On top of that, the city’s 90-day shelter limit has forced repeated relocations, leading to constant school transfers that disrupt both learning and emotional stability.
  </p>

  <h2 class="subhed">Constant moves, constant disruption</h2>

  <p>
    With no clear data, however, it’s tough to track how many migrant students are still in classrooms—or have disappeared from them.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Many immigrant students don’t stay long. They leave because of housing costs. Teachers work so hard to make them feel welcome, and then they’re gone," said Tatyana Kleyn, an associate professor in Bilingual Education at the City College of New York.
  </p>

  <p>
    But even with the latest wave of new arrivals, experts had long warned of a shortage of ELL teachers, many already stretched thin with duties well beyond their official job description.
  </p>

  <p>
    “English isn’t going to rectify all the challenges these students are facing. It's really about looking at them holistically—where they are socio-emotionally, what experiences they’ve had, what their families need,” said Kleyn.
  </p>

  <p>
    "We’ve been advocating for schools to hire immigrant liaisons—someone who’s on top of the legal changes, who can connect families to the right services. Schools can’t do this alone."
  </p>

  <p>
    A strong social service safety net is not merely a nice-to-have, argued Dafny Irizarry, founder and president of the Long Island Latino Teachers Association and ELL teacher.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today’s ELL learners “come to school under immense stress, fearing deportation or family separation. That fear and instability seriously affect their ability to focus and learn."
